# Financial Chat Bot

This chat bot is developed as part of the BCG's Generative AI internship simulation. The chat has not been fully implemented. Currently, the supported questions are
1. Revenue of <company> in <year>
2. Change in income for <company>

Other questions will be implemented in the future.

The chat bot has been deployed in streamlit. To run the app, enter these commands in terminal:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
